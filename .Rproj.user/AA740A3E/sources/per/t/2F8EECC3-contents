## Introduction

This document walks through example simulation code used to produce the results obtained in 'Penalized model-based clustering of fMRI' submitted to the journal Biostatistics. First, we install and load the version of the R package used for the submitted manuscript:

```{r}
# Install version of package used for Biostatistics submission
if("rcm" %in% installed.packages() == FALSE) {
devtools::install_github("dilernia/rcm@biostatistics")
}

# Load package
library(rcm)
```
